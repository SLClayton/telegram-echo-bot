# Serverless AWS Telegram Echo Bot

This project demonstrates the barebones code and infrastructure needed to create a basic serverless, event-driven, Telegram echo bot on AWS. 

By using Telegramâ€™s webhook approach in a serverless environment, you benefit from an event-driven model, meaning the bot only runs when a new message is 'pushed' from telegram. And there is no need to keep polling the telegram API waiting for new messages. This reduces costs by charging only for actual invocations (rather than continuously running server).

## Pre-requisits

### Bot Token
You will need to setup a telegram bot and obtain its bot token, [instructions can be found on the telegram website](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token)

### AWS CLI
An authenticated AWS CLI session is required to build AWS resources using terraform. To download AWS CLI and login, follow the tutorials linked.

### Terraform
[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Python
This project was built using python 3.10. However it should work with any most modern versions of python 3. If you use a different version ensure to edit the lambda resource in main.tf to match the version you're using to avoid issues.

## Setup

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/SLClayton/telegram-echo-bot.git
```

Go to the terraform directory

```
cd telegram-echo-bot/terraform
```

Initialise the terraform project

```
terraform init
```

Apply the terraform project, it will ask you to input your bot token, and then will ask you to confirm the deployment by typing 'yes'.

```
terraform apply
```

Add your bot on telegram using the username you created with the Botfather, and send it a message.
