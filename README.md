# Serverless AWS Telegram Echo Bot (Python)

This project demonstrates the barebones code and infrastructure needed to create a basic serverless, event-driven, Telegram echo bot on AWS. 

By using Telegramâ€™s webhook approach in a serverless environment, you benefit from an event-driven model, meaning the bot only runs when a new message is 'pushed' from telegram. And there is no need to keep polling the telegram API waiting for new messages. This reduces costs by charging only for actual invocations (rather than continuously running server).

## How it works

This project utilises Telegram's webhook functionality to call a single AWS Lambda function via its function URL. This function then utilises the Telegram API to send a message back to whatever Telegram user has sent one to the bot. The Terraform file will build all necessary permissions and roles, as well as the Lambda. It will also call the Telegram API to set up the webhook to match the Lambda function's URL automatically.

## Pre-requisits

### Bot Token
You will need to setup a telegram bot and obtain its bot token. 

[Obtain your bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token)

### AWS CLI
An authenticated AWS CLI session is required to build AWS resources using terraform. To download AWS CLI and login, follow the tutorials linked.

### Terraform
[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Python
This project was built using python 3.10. However it should work with any most modern versions of python 3. If you use a different version, ensure to edit the lambda resource in main.tf to match the version you're using to avoid issues.

## Setup

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/SLClayton/telegram-echo-bot.git
```

Go to the terraform directory

```
cd telegram-echo-bot/terraform
```

Initialise the terraform project

```
terraform init
```

Apply the terraform project, it will ask you to input your bot token, and then ask you to confirm the deployment by typing 'yes'.

```
terraform apply
```

You can alternativley setup a [.tfvars file to manage the variables](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-tfvars) and input the telegram token there before applying with the file as an argument.

```
terraform apply -var-file=<your-var-filename>.tfvars
```

Add your bot on telegram using the username you created with the Botfather, and send it a message.
